Retrospective Notes for Version 2:

Fix performance
Always need to have in mind, way we handle webcam
	Webcam stream, multiple streams,
	Keep tidying up back end code
	Encapsulation
	
Doggy filter
	Works, only needs to be integrated
	Image is split into multiple image, trickest part
	Definitely push to get done since already mostly finished
		Nose always lines up well, ears are a problem
		Audio loop
Further testing
Check on different platforms
On mobile, how the filter part works
